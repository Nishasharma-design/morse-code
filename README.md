REQUIREMENTS/PURPOSE

### MVP

Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

translate their English text into Morse Code
Morse Code into English text
Make sure to add tests for all your translate logic, you want to have some pure functions that take an input and return that input translated
Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)

### PURPOSE

- To convert Morse code to english text and vice-versa
- To explore functionality of Javascript and play around with HTML and CSS

## STACK USED
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## DESIGN GOALS / APPROACH
- To explore HTML, CSS and javascript 

## FEATURES
- Project can translate Morse code to english text and vice-versa as we type in.

## ISSUES
- The project is not passing two tests out of 11 total tests.

## FUTURE GOALS
- I want to add few more tests and add music functionality

## STRUGGLES
- code displayed right outputs at console but was failing at testing, then i did some google research, which advised to install jest-environment-jsdom manually
